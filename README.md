This project is a Reaction testing game, where you can test your reaction time. When initially started, it displays "Click to Start" in which if the user click the button, the game begins. After the button is pressed, the next display is "Click whenGreen" which starts a randomized timer for the green LED to turn on. When the timer ends, and the green LED turns on, a stopwatch is started until the user presses the button one more time. After the time is stopped, the screen will display "elapsed time = X:XXX" and will stay on screen until user presses button 3 times. After the button is pressed 3 times, the screen will display "Click to Play Again." If the user pressees the button again, it will bring the user back to "Click when green" and repeat the cycle.
